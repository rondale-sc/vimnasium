# 002 GQ

Welcome again to vimnasium!  Today we are going to tackled a formatting command
that I just recently became aware of.  In fact, I learned about it while writing
the previous edition of Vimnasium.  After I had been writing for a paragraph or
so I decided that I'd like to wrap the article to a width of 80 characters.  In
order to do that I ran `set textwidth=80`, which worked a treat.  However, the
paragraph I had already written was still wrapped to max width.  So I looked for
a simple Vim solution, and found the perfect thing; `gq`.
